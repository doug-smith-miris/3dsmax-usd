## Changelog


### Unreleased (Miris fork)

#### Fixes:
- [MAX-CAM-001] Camera export: always author `UsdGeomCamera.clippingRange`. The writer previously gated `CreateClippingRangeAttr()` on `GenCamera::GetManualClip() != 0`, so any camera with "Clip Manually" off (the default for newly-created Free / Target / Physical cameras) exported with no `clippingRange` attribute and silently fell back to the `UsdGeomCamera` schema default of `(1.0, 1000000.0)` -- a near plane of 1 inch and a far plane of ~25 km at Max's default inch units. `CameraWriter::Write` now reads `GetClipDist(...)` unconditionally and authors the result on every exported camera. The clip distance values are stored on every Max camera regardless of the "Clip Manually" toggle; the toggle only controls whether Max's *renderer* honours them, so honouring them in USD is correct in both cases. Degenerate values (≤ 0, NaN, far ≤ near) are sanity-clamped to `(1.0, 1000.0)` in scene units. The splines-mode warning is preserved but still gated on `GetManualClip() != 0`. See `doc/translation-mapping.md`.
- [MAX-MAT-001] MaterialX export: strip the spurious `specular_rotation = 0.25` default that 3ds Max's `MtlxIOUtil` bridge writes on every `ND_standard_surface_surfaceshader`. The MaterialX nodedef default is 0.0, and the value has no visual effect when `specular_anisotropy` is zero; the spurious value is preserved by `MtlxShaderWriter` only when anisotropy is provably non-zero. See `doc/translation-mapping.md`.
- [MAX-MAT-002] MaterialX export: strip the spurious `emission = 1.0` paired with `emission_color = (0, 0, 0)` that 3ds Max's `MtlxIOUtil` bridge writes on every `ND_standard_surface_surfaceshader`. The MaterialX nodedef defaults (`emission = 0.0`, `emission_color = (1, 1, 1)`) evaluate to the same zero emission with the correct semantic meaning; the spurious pair is only removed when both values match the buggy pattern exactly. See `doc/translation-mapping.md`.
- [MAX-MAT-003] Mesh export: stop leaking the 3ds Max viewport wireframe color into `primvars:displayColor` on meshes that have a material bound. The wireframe color is a scene-graph organizational tag; using it as displayColor misled USD consumers that fall back to displayColor when the bound material can't be evaluated (minimal Hydra delegates, ARKit Quick Look paths without MaterialX, the usdview displayColor overlay, thumbnailers). `MeshConverter::ConvertToUSDMesh` now derives displayColor from the bound material's `GetDiffuse()` when one is bound, and falls back to the wireframe color only when no material is bound. See `doc/translation-mapping.md`.
- [MAX-GEO-001] Mesh export: add a new `NormalsMode::Both` and make it the new default. The historical default `NormalsMode::AsPrimvar` authored only `primvars:normals` and left the `UsdGeomMesh.normals` schema attribute unset, which silently broke consumers that read the schema attribute first (ARKit Quick Look historically, minimal Hydra delegates in some configurations, USDZ thumbnailers without the full primvar resolver). `Both` populates both locations from the same source normals (primvar stays indexed, schema attribute is flattened) so any USD consumer sees the authored normals regardless of which carrier it queries. The MAXScript enum gains `#both`; the existing `#asPrimvar` and `#asAttribute` selectors are unchanged. See `doc/translation-mapping.md`.
- [MAX-GEO-004] Mesh export: backfill `primvars:st` (or the channel-1-configured primvar name) with a fallback planar projection of the vertex positions whenever `MeshConverter::ApplyMaxMapChannels` did not author it. 3ds Max parametric primitives (`Box` / `Sphere` / `Cylinder` / `Torus` / `Teapot`) default `Generate Mapping Coords.` to false when constructed via MAXScript without an explicit `mapCoords:true` argument, leaving the converted MNMesh's channel 1 empty and the exported USD with no UV stream — lethal for any texture-bearing material bound to the mesh. The fallback is a top-down XY planar projection normalized to the mesh's bounding box, written with `vertex` interpolation. Conservatively does nothing when the user explicitly opted out of channel-1 export, when real UVs already exist, or when the mesh is degenerate. Emits a `MaxUsd::Log::Warn` so the artist knows the projection is a fallback and how to fix it properly (enable `Generate Mapping Coords.` on the source primitive, or apply a UVW Map modifier). See `doc/translation-mapping.md`.
- [MAX-GEO-002] Mesh export: stop emitting ghost `GeomSubset` prims in the `materialBind` family when the bound material is not a Multi/Sub-Object material. 3ds Max parametric primitives (`Box`, `Cylinder`, `Cone`, `ChamferBox`, ...) default each face to a distinct sub-material id, so `MeshConverter::ApplyMaxMaterialIDs` previously emitted one `GeomSubset` per face (Box → 6 subsets, Cylinder → 3) even when the artist bound a single PhysicalMaterial at the node level. Those subsets carry `familyName = "materialBind"` and a `customData.3dsmax.matId` value but **no** `material:binding` of their own — they are pure layer bloat and mislead consumers (USDZ packagers, scene-graph viewers, Hydra delegate configurations) that interpret `materialBind` partitioning as authored intent for per-face material variation. The new gate generalises the existing `materialIdToFacesMap.size() == 1` early-out: when the bound material is null or non-MultiMtl, collapse to the single-`customData.3dsmax.matId` path so the round-trip importer's `GetMaterialIdFromCustomData` still sees a sensible value. Existing subsets on a re-exported prim are preserved (we never destroy prior authoring). Emits a `MaxUsd::Log::Warn` explaining the collapse and how to preserve per-face partitioning (bind a Multi/Sub-Object material). See `doc/translation-mapping.md`.
- [MAX-GEO-003] Mesh export: rename the `GeomSubset` fallback naming pattern from the legacy underscore-wrapped `_{N}_` (e.g. `_1_`, `_2_`) to the readable `mat_{N}` form (e.g. `mat_1`, `mat_2`). `MaterialUtils::CreateSubsetName` applied the legacy pattern in two branches — (a) when the bound material is null or non-Multi, and (b) when a `MultiMtl` has an empty slot name — producing subset prim names like `/root/Box/_1_` that are ugly in `usdview`'s Prim Tree, awkward to grep for, and diverge from the `mat_*` / `submat_*` convention used by Maya USD, Houdini Solaris, and the broader USD ecosystem. Cosmetic only: subset names are opaque metadata to renderers (Karma SHA-256-identical prefix vs postfix) and the round-trip importer (`TranslatorMaterial.cpp`) treats them as opaque strings, so older USD files with `_N_` subsets still read back unchanged. Unit and ShellMtl integration tests updated to assert the new pattern; the back-compat read test (`import_material_id_test.ms`) still constructs synthetic `_N_` inputs and is intentionally unchanged. See `doc/translation-mapping.md`.

### v0.12.3

#### What's New:
- Updated the way anonymous layers are named. Instead of using the layer identifier, anonymous layers are now named with the convention of "anonymousLayerX", where X is the nth anonymous layer at the current level.
- Updated the cloning of USD prims via SHIFT+DRAG to preserve the original prim's reference instead of making a chain of references if there is a single reference entry on the dragged prim. This improves the cleanliness of the USD data.
- Automatically opens the USD Explorer when creating a new USD Stage that has an anonymous root layer.
- Added support to remember usd layer edit targets even for anonymous layers.
- Added Project-based tokens to the USD Asset Resolver. This will enable tokens that match those folders made by a standard Max project settings.
- Added new option in USD Exporter to export materials without requiring geometry in the export.
- Added a new method to the USDStageObject called SetStageFromCache(ID) that allows you to set change the stage used in a USDStageObject from a stage in the USD cache by passing the stage's cacheid.

#### Fixes:
- Fixed the USD Layer Editor failing to show a layer stack below any layers brought in using Stage Variable Expressions.
- Improved poor performance when duplicating many objects into a USD Stage.
- Updated the Stage Reload button in the command panel of a USDStageObject to only reload file-backed layers allowing anonymous root layers and anonymous layers belonging to all anonymous root layers to remain when reloading a stage.

### v0.12.2

#### What's New:
- Added first iteration of being able to copy prims in a USD Stage using Shift+Drag in the viewport. At this time, the feature is limited to making an Internal Reference to the "copied" prim, meaning it is prone to break if the source prim moves in the USD hierarchy.
- Added a menu to set/unset a prim in a USD Stage as the stage's default prim. The default prim is needed to properly reference a USD scene into other USD files without having to specify a prim path.
- Added new option in the viewport quad menus to duplicate selected Max objects into a new stage instead of requiring a stage from file or existing stage node.
- Added default values for new stages to set the up-axis, units and FPS based on the current Max scene settings.

- Updated menus for creating a USD Stage from file to automatically select the USDStageObject upon creation.
- Updated the USD Layer Editor to set layers to System Lock when the layer is a read-only file on disk.
- Updated lights gizmos from a USD stage to appear yellow to match Max behaviors. Selected lights are still the color of the USD Stage Object selection color.
- Added a new USD Prim Pick mode that can be initiated from the new UsdSharedComponents extension. To load the extension use `maxExtension = Python.Import("UsdSharedComponents.maxExtension");` to call the pick mode, use `maxExtension.PickPrim(stage)` where stage is a python object storing the stage. This function acts similarly to the MAXScript `PickObject()` method but is for returning UFE paths that allow you to process the picked prims for custom purposes.
- Update Max USD to default to the Root Layer as the Edit Target when creating a new stage object. Previously we targeted the session layer by default, but now that the Layer Editor is available we moved it to the Root Layer.
- Added "Class Prims" entry into the USD Explorer Display menu to Show/Hide USD prims in the USD Explorer.

#### Fixes:
- Fixed a crash in the USD Stage Object when switching between kinds and prim object/sub-object mode.
- Fixed the display of prim hierarchy in the USD Explorer when adding a prim to a class prim.
- Fixed defect where reordering layers in the USD Layer Editor could remove the layers entirely.
- Fixed incorrect warning of unsaved edits in a stage when exporting a scene with a stage that generated session data for automatic pointInstance draw modes.
- Properly expose the 3ds Max USD python method `maxUsd.JobContextRegistry.GetJobContextInfo()`.

- Added ability to create a new stage from file from the USD Layer Editor.
- Added options for saving dirty layers in a USD Stage when saving a Max scene. Note that in the current iteration, this will create a pop-up even during Autosave to determine what to do with dirty layers. We intend to address this in a coming update.
- The bulk save function in the USD Layer Editor displays the number of layers needing saved.
- Added a right-click menu to print a layer in the USD Layer Editor to the MAXScript Listener. If the layer is more than 400 lines or 50K characters, the function will ask to confirm the print before printing since very large datasets can take a long time to print.
- The USD Layer Editor can now reload a selected layer.
- The Mute and Lock states of a USD Layer is now preserved between Max sessions.
- Users can now launch the USD Layer Editor from the USD Explorer as well as the `Tools > USD > USD Layer Editor...` menu.

### v0.9.4

#### What's New:
- Added support for displaying USD Light shapes in the viewport. Note they do not cast lights into the viewport but can be selected and edited. The results will render in renderers with USD support.
- Update some labels and tooltips around the Draw Mode functions in the USD Stage Object.
- Updated the MaterialX Plugin to use MaterialX version 1.38.8 for 3ds Max 2025.

- Fixed an issue where Display Purpose may not sync correctly when changing the file reference in an existing USD Stage or when changing display purposes.

### v0.9.3

#### What's New:
- Updated the USD Exporter to better convert Max Shapes into USD instead of always exporting to linear interpolations.
- Added USD Layer Editor to target layers for USD edits.
- Updated the MaterialX Material to save the current material by name instead of index. This guarantees that sub-materials in a USD remain intact in Max even if the MaterialX document changes the ordering of materials.
- Exposed more of the MaterialX Exporter options to MAXScript.
- Updated the MaterialX plugin to support importing MaterialX documents using OpenPBR shaders.
- Introducing the concept of a devkit archive delivered inside the 3dsMax USD plugin installation. The devkit includes all the 3ds Max USD SDK files (includes and libs), the samples and the minimal dependencies (includes and libs) required to compile the samples (or any third-party add-on plugin for the 3ds Max USD plugin). Additionally, the devkit contains the other dependencies required to compile the open-sourced 3ds Max USD plugin (still in preparation). The previous 3ds Max USD SDK archive is not produced anymore. The devkit is its replacement.
